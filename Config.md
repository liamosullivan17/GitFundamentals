# git config

When first setting up git, you'll need to work with the git config commands in order to set up your identity.

For example, your identity can be set up wit hterminal commands such as:

```
git config --global user.name "liamosullivan17"
git config --global user.email "liam.s.osullivan@gmail.com"
